JS is a single threaded language - it can do one thing at a time, it can execute one piece of code at a time

what event loop does it - it pushes the function from task queue to stack, seeing if the stack is empty, and then the stack executes the function
event loop has to wait until the stack is clear before it can push the callback on to the stack from the task queue

the V8 chrome engine have all these things - task queue, stack(function execution), console, heap (memory allocation) and Web APIs - which contains all the other apis like DOM, ajax, setTimeOut etc/.

when people say don't block the event loop. it means the constant rendering part is being rendering via the task queue(callback queue), and when you add sluggish code - image processing and animations - then get into the stack and for that time the event loop is blocked, preventing smooth rendering - browser can't do what it needs to do, create a nice fluid UI - so be careful about how you queue up the code
